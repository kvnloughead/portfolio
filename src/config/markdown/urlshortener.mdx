Send a `POST` request to

```bash
https://stubbyurl.herokuapp.com/api/shorturl
```

with a URL in its body

```json
{ "url": "https://example.com" }
```

and you'll receive a shortened url `short_url` in the response. You can then
navigate to the original URL with

```bash
https://stubbyurl.herokuapp.com/api/shorturl/:short_url
```
