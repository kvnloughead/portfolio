export const metadata = {
  authors: ['Kevin'],
};

This is an example project. Place an image where the images go 
and fill in data in the relevant config file. See the config 
readme for details. The text can be written in __markdown__, 
and support code blocks with syntax highlighting, so

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```


By default, up to three projects are shown, and the rest are
hidden behind a `Show More` button.
